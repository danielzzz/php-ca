This script makes creation of new openvpn users easier.
It autogenerates keys and configuration files.

It creates a directory with all keys and config files and a tar.gz file for easy copying to your client machine.

$openVPNPort - the port used by openvpn
$serverCertPath - the path of the ca.crt file
